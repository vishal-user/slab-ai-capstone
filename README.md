🚀 SLAB.AI 2.0 - Lead to Learning Platform
A modern, cloud-native EdTech platform with complete DevOps implementation - from infrastructure automation to production deployment.

🎯 Business Value
Lead Conversion - Capture and nurture learner interest into paid enrollments
Scalable Infrastructure - Handle campaign spikes with auto-scaling
Enterprise Security - Protect PII and payment data with zero-trust architecture
Measurable Performance - API p95 < 300ms, global CDN delivery
🏗️ Production Architecture
CloudFront → ALB → EKS Cluster → MongoDB Atlas ↑ Frontend (React) + Backend (Node.js) Nginx Proxy → Backend API

🚀 DevOps Implementation
✅ Infrastructure as Code
cd infrastructure/terraform/ terraform init terraform plan terraform apply

✅ Completed: VPC, EKS Cluster, ECR Repositories, S3 Buckets, Load Balancers

✅ Kubernetes Deployment

Cluster access
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ca-central-1 --name slab-ai-dev-dev

Application deployment
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/ ✅ Deployed: Backend API (2 replicas), Frontend React App (2 replicas), Services, LoadBalancer

✅ Production Evidence EKS Cluster: slab-ai-dev-dev in ca-central-1 (2 worker nodes) Backend APIs: Leads, Courses, Auth, Payments fully operational Frontend: Accessible via LoadBalancer with nginx proxy Services: Internal service discovery working Health Checks: All pods running with zero restarts

🛡️ Security Features
Input validation with express-validator JWT authentication with secure token storage Helmet security headers CORS configuration Private networking with service isolation Health checks and readiness probes

📊 API Endpoints (✅ VERIFIED WORKING)
GET /health - System health POST /api/leads - Capture leads GET /api/leads - List leads
GET /api/courses - List courses POST /api/auth/register - User registration POST /api/payments/create-intent - Payment processing

🎯 Deployment Success Metrics
✅ Infrastructure: EKS cluster with 2 worker nodes ✅ Applications: Backend + Frontend deployed successfully ✅ Networking: LoadBalancer provisioned with external access ✅ Reliability: All pods healthy, zero crash loops ✅ Scalability: Multiple replicas with rolling updates ✅ API Connectivity: Frontend → Nginx Proxy → Backend working perfectly

🔧 Quick Start
Local Development

Start all services
docker-compose up --build

Production Deployment (✅ PROVEN WORKING)

1. Infrastructure
cd infrastructure/terraform/ terraform apply -auto-approve

2. Cluster access
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region ca-central-1 --name slab-ai-dev-dev

3. Deploy applications
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/

4. Access production
kubectl get service slab-ai-frontend-lb -n slab-ai
